	 * for the iframed canvas: _wp_get_iframed_editor_assets() fires it and returns
	 * both the printed styles AND scripts, which the canvas injects into its own
	 * document. It is explicitly the hook for front-end assets that need to run

	 * purpose: mounting Stripe Elements or the PayPal SDK would pull third-party
	 * scripts into wp-admin on every editor load and open live gateway connections
	 * for a preview the author cannot interact with. Those keep their static
	 * placeholders (see _editor-preview.scss).
	 *
	 * Both initialisers are safe here — each is ready-state aware, guards against
